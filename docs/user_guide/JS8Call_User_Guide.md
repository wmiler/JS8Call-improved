 JS8Call is an experiment in combining the robustness of
 FT8 (a weak-signal mode by K1JT) with a messaging and network protocol
 layer for weak signal *communication*. The open source software is
 designed for connecting amateur radio operators who are operating
 under weak signal conditions and offers real-time keyboard-to-keyboard
 messaging, stored (inbox) messaging, message relay, and automatic
 station announcements. JS8Call is heavily inspired by
 [WSJT-X](https://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/k1jt/wsjtx.html),
 [Fldigi](http://www.w1hkj.com/), and
 [FSQCall](http://www.qsl.net/zl1bpu/MFSK/FSQweb.htm) and would not
 exist without the hard work and dedication of the many developers in
 the amateur radio community.

 ## History

- **July 6, 2017** - The initial idea of using a modification to the FT8
  protocol to support long-form QSOs was developed by Jordan, KN4CRD,
  and submitted to the WSJT-X mailing list:
  [https://sourceforge.net/p/wsjt/mailman/message/35931540/](https://sourceforge.net/p/wsjt/mailman/message/35931540/)

- **August 31, 2017** - Jordan, KN4CRD, did a little development and
  modified WSJT-X to support long-form QSOs using the existing FT8
  protocol:
  [https://sourceforge.net/p/wsjt/mailman/message/36020051/](https://sourceforge.net/p/wsjt/mailman/message/36020051/)

  He sent a video example to the WSJT-X group:
  [https://widefido.wistia.com/medias/7bb1uq62ga](https://widefido.wistia.com/medias/7bb1uq62ga)

- **January 8, 2018** - Jordan, KN4CRD, started working on the design of
   a long-form QSO application built on top of FT8 with a redesigned
   interface.

- **February 9, 2018** - Jordan, KN4CRD, submitted question to the
  WSJT-X group to see if there was any interest in pursuing the idea:
  [https://sourceforge.net/p/wsjt/mailman/message/36221549/](https://sourceforge.net/p/wsjt/mailman/message/36221549/)

- **February 10, 2018** - Jordan KN4CRD, Julian OH8STN, John N0JDS, and
  the Portable Digital QRP group did an experiment using FSQ. The idea
  of FT8Call, combining FT8, long-form QSOs, and FSQCall like features
  was born.

- **February 11, 2018** - Jordan, KN4CRD, inquired about the idea of
  integrating long-form messages into WSJT-X:
  [https://sourceforge.net/p/wsjt/mailman/message/36223372/](https://sourceforge.net/p/wsjt/mailman/message/36223372/)

## Notice

JS8Call is a **derivative** of the WSJT-X application, restructured
and redesigned for message passing using a custom FSK modulation
called JS8. It is not supported by nor endorsed by the WSJT-X
development group. While the WSJT-X group maintains copyright over the
original work and code, JS8Call is a derivative work licensed under
and in accordance with the terms of the [GPLv3
license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html). The source code
modifications are public and can be found in `js8call` branch of this
repository:
[https://bitbucket.org/widefido/js8call/](https://bitbucket.org/widefido/js8call/)

JS8Call is and will always be **open-source** and **free** software
(free as in beer and free as in speech, do with it what you like, for
the sum of exactly \$0).

You might be asking\...why is this named JS8Call? Why was it renamed
from FT8Call? Why not something else, like BACON or HF Messenger? Good
question! It is named this way as an homage to its heritage:

- JS8Call was previously named FT8Call.
- JS8Call uses a custom FT8 modulation called JS8 (Jordan Sherer designed 8-FSK modulation). This is the base RF transport.
- JS8Call has a "directed calling" protocol laid over top the base RF transport to support free-form and directed message passing.

Hence JS8 + Directed Calling = JS8Call. And in case you didn't get
that:

- The app is: **JS8Call**
- The mode is: **JS8**

## Download & Install

JS8Call currently comes in a variety of builds.

- Desktop Linux (64-bit x86_64, deb)
- Desktop Linux (32-bit i386, deb)
- Raspbian Stretch (armv7, deb)
- Windows 10 (win32_64)
  - Windows 10 is the only officially supported Windows build at this
    time, but the application has been confirmed to work all the way
    back to Windows XP.
- Mac OSX 10.11+ (x86_64)

Binary downloads are available here:
[http://files.js8call.com/latest.html](http://files.js8call.com/latest.html)

Of course, you are always free to take a look at the [source
code](https://bitbucket.org/widefido/js8call/) as well!

## Getting Started

### Clock Sync / Timing

In the application you can see the current time reported by your PC in
UTC format. An accurate clock is important with JS8Call, as the
decoder operates within a 15-second window of transmission (frames).
Your clock being off greater than 2 seconds from UTC can cause
messages to not decode at your station. It is best to use an Internet,
NTP or GPS time source for synchronizing your clock as accurately as
possible.

JS8Call includes an automatic and manual clock drift tool that you can
use to modify your application time to match signals you see / hear
(or to an external time source like a Timex watch, a handheld GPS
device, WWV, or a rooster crowing). This is intended to be used as a
fail-safe for when your synchronized time source is not available
(like if you were out portable, away from internet connectivity).

``NOTE: You do not actually have to have the exact time
synchronized...just synchronized to the start of a transmission
window (15, 10, or 6 seconds), +/- 2 seconds. Many operators can
manually synchronize their system clock based on signals in the
waterfall and the time drift reported for each station.``

### USB - Upper Sideband Only

Make sure your rig is set to upper sideband (USB) mode for every band.
If you are running lower sideband (LSB), you'll likely see reversed
signals you cannot decode.

### Duty Cycle

The JS8 modulator is a constant envelope, full-duty modulation that
transmits in 12.6 second frames in normal speed. Because of the dead
air between transmission frames, multi-frame messages can be
classified as 84% duty on a 15-second window (12.6 / 15 = 0.84) for
normal and slow (25.28 / 30 = 0.84), 79% for fast on a
10-second window (7.9 / 10 = 0.79), 65% for turbo on a 6-second window
(3.95 / 6 = 0.653), .

Please make note of the power restrictions your transceiver
manufacturer recommends for full-duty digital transmissions. When in
doubt, use only a maximum of 50% of your rig's power output to "save
your finals".

### Audio Levels

Your input and output audio levels control how well you transmit and
receive. Too high and the audio becomes distorted. Too low and you
have no modulation / demodulation. Calibration is an important step to
getting started.

#### Output & ALC

A rule of thumb is to set your output audio just high enough to drive
your transmitter while not engaging your ALC. If you drive your audio
too high, your ALC will distort the tones and many stations will not
be able to decode your transmissions.

#### Input & AGC

For best decodes, it's best to turn off your AGC (or set it to fast)
and set your input audio just high enough to read somewhere around
30-40dB on the signal meter in the app. You might have to experiment
with the settings that work best for your station and you might also
have to engage your attenuator for strong signals.

## Your First QSO

TODO: We'll eventually add an example here :)

## Operating JS8Call

If you've used FSQ, Fldigi or WSJT-X before, you'll feel right at home
with JS8Call. The premise is that JS8Call uses JS8 modulated messages,
breaking up long free-text messages into multiple **back-to-back**
transmission cycles with a few seconds of silence between "frames".

### Mode Speed

JS8Call 2.0 introduced two new faster mode speeds for QSOs and 2.1
introduced a slow mode. The four speeds now available in JS8 are:

- Slow - 30 second frames - 25Hz bandwidth - and around 8WPM decoded down to -28dB
- Normal - 15 second frames - 50Hz bandwidth - and around 16WPM decoded down to -24dB
- Fast - 10 second frames - 80Hz bandwidth - and around 24WPM decoded down to -20dB
- Turbo- 6 second frames - 160Hz bandwidth - and around 40WPM decoded down to -18dB

The intent of the faster speeds is to start your QSO in normal and
\"upgrade\" to the faster speeds if conditions support it. If you have
a modern PC with a performant CPU, you can optionally enable MULTI
from the mode menu, allowing the decoder to decode all mode speeds at
once.

### Band Activity

Band activity is displayed on the left. Call activity (callsigns
you\'ve heard) are on the right. Right clicking will show a menu with
an option to move your RX/TX offset to that audio frequency and send
specific messages.

### Call Activity

In the Call Activity, when a station responds to you a ★ indicator
will be displayed next to their callsign. This helps you find, at a
glance, other operators that are *confirmed* to be able to hear you.

When a station is calling CQ, a ☎ indicator will be displayed next to
their callsign for 5 minutes. This helps you find, at a glance, other
operators that are looking to make contact.

If a station has left you a message, a ⚑ indicator will be displayed
next to their callsign. You can read that message by right clicking on
the station and clicking "Show Message Inbox".

Station distance and azimuth is computed from the first 6 digits of
the maidenhead grid locators. This is an approximation describing an
"area" on the map, not an exact point. JS8Call supports up to 12 digit
locators for greater precision, but even then, the calculation will
always remain an approximation.

### Waterfall

There is a waterfall at the bottom of the screen to show you the
signals in your audio passband. You can click on the waterfall to set
your audio frequency offset.

There is also an option to change your VFO frequency (QSY) to center
your selected audio offset to the rig passband center. This allows you
to use narrow filters easily and is helpful for rigs with non-linear
passbands.

By opening the waterfall controls (View-\>Show Waterfall Controls) you
can configure your waterfall display, access a filtering feature
(limiting which frequencies the decoder will try to decode), and the
timing feature (allowing you to drift your local time sync to match a
station).

### Messages

The top yellow text box shows you messages that are either on the
frequency offset you\'re on or who have directed a message to you
(they sent a message that included your callsign).

You type into the white box on the bottom to prepare a message for
transmission.

Normal FT8 character restrictions **do not** apply! The extended
character set includes all printable uppercase ASCII ```(A-Z 0-9 Space
./?+-`\~!@#\$%\^&\*()\_=\[\]\\}\|;':",\<\>)``` and Latin 1 
```(¡¿ÀÁÂÃÄÅÆÇÈÉÊËÌÍÎÏÐÑÒÓÔÕÖØÙÚÛÜÝÞ)```. The message structure is variable
encoded, so the most common characters take the least amount of space,
and special characters take longer to send.

As you type your message you'll see the send button display the
transmission time it'll take to send your complete message. All you
have to do is click send (or hit enter) to start transmitting on the
next interval. As each frame is transmitted one after the other, the
button will update with the amount of time left to transmit the
message. JS8Call 2.0 supports typeahead, so you can start transmitting
and continue typing your message as each frame is
transmitted. Checksummed messages like MSG or Relays cannot use
typeahead.

Because of this special variable encoding, messages in JS8Call cannot
be decoded by WSJT-X. The same is also true, WSJT-X messages will not
be shown in JS8Call.

### Message Types

Messages come in three forms:

1.  standard JS8Call free text messages
2.  undirected JS8Call messages
3.  directed JS8Call messages

#### Standard Messages

Standard messages are free-text messages that do not start with a
callsign or a directed command. These messages will only print at
other station locations if they align their receive offset within 10Hz
of your transmit offset. This operation is similar to other
keyboard-to-keyboard digital modes, like Olivia, RTTY, and PSK.

#### Directed Messages

Directed messages are special JS8Call transmissions that automatically
prefix your message with your callsign, similar to how FSQCall
operates. Directed messages are useful for communicating in that you
do not have to include your callsign in your message, allowing you to
use more of the transmission frame(s) for actual message text, as well
as alerting the recipient that a message was sent to them. As long as
you are in the same passband, you do not have to be on the same
frequency offset to receive a directed message.

To send a directed message, all you need to do is include the callsign
of the receiving station as the first word in the message or select a
callsign in your heard list to have it automatically prefixed.

You'll notice a special character at the end of the message, ala **♢** .
This is a symbol to indicate the End of Transmission. JS8Call displays
this as after the last frame of the message has been transmitted with
nothing else to follow. This means you get a visual indicator that the
transmission is done and you can begin transmitting a reply. This
character can be customized in the Conﬁguration.

Directed messages to you (and to @ALLCALL) are displayed in the top RX
window.

When in the middle of receiving a directed message (i.e., after the
first directed frame is received), your station will not respond
automatically to commands (even with AUTO on) until that message is
received or enough time has elapsed to move on (one minute from the
last frame decoded).

#### Group Messages

Group directed messages are specially formatted JS8Call transmissions
that announce your station via CQ or Heartbeats (HB) to the @ALLCALL
and @HB callsign groups. They are directed at a group destination, but
not generally to an individual station.

#### @ALLCALL Callsign

There is a special "@ALLCALL" group callsign that you can use to send
the message to anybody who is able to receive your message. Some
examples:

- @ALLCALL HELLO NET PSE QSY 14300

  - Will be sent as: **KN4CRD: @ALLCALL HELLO NET PSE QSY 14300♢**

#### Group Callsigns

Group callsigns are a custom form of compound callsigns that begin
with an "@" character, and can be up to 8 alpha-numeric (A-Z 0-9)
characters in length.. If you modeled that in a regular expression,
that would be:

``\[@\]\[A-Z0-9\\\]{0,3}\[\\\]?\[A-Z0-9\\\]{0,3}\[\\\]?\[A-Z0-9\\\]{0,3}``

Group callsign functionality allows you to direct your message to
anybody who has "joined" the group. You join the group by adding the
group name to your settings. All stations who want to receive group
messages must add the group to their station configuration. Stations
without the group will still be able to see the message received in
the band activity, but those messages will not be directed to them.

Say for example, I was part of the Georgia ARES group and I wanted to
send other folks in the group a message, I'd send:

`KN4CRD: @ARESGA QSL?`

This group callsign will behave similarly to @ALLCALL. Everybody who
has added the @ARESGA group to their station configuration will have
the message printed on the screen. If instead, I transmitted:

`KN4CRD: @ARESGA SNR?`

Then, all group member stations who have AUTO enabled would respond
with a signal report, similar to if you queried each group station
individually.

There are a number of built-in group callsigns that can be transmitted
just as efficiently as standard callsigns. All custom groups will
require an extra frame during transmission:

|        |           |          |          |          |         |
|--------|-----------|----------|----------|----------|---------|
| **Continental DX** | **ITU Regions** | **Generic Groups** | **Operator Groups** | **Special Groups** | **Additional Groups** |
| @DX/NA | @REGION/1 | @GROUP/0 | @COMMAND | @JS8NET  | @EMCOMM  |
| @DX/SA | @REGION/2 | @GROUP/1 | @CONTROL | @APRSIS  | @ARES    |
| @DX/EU | @REGION/3 | @GROUP/2 | @NTS     | @RAGCHEW | @MARS    |
| @DX/AS |           | @GROUP/3 | @NET     | @JS8     | @RACES   |
| @DX/AF |           | @GROUP/4 |          | @AMRRON  | @RADAR   |
| @DX/OC |           | @GROUP/5 |          | @CQ      | @SKYWARN |
| @DX/AN |           | @GROUP/6 |          | @HB      | @CONTEST |
|        |           | @GROUP/7 |          | @QSO     | @FIELDDAY|
|        |           | @GROUP/8 |          | @QSOPARTY| @SOTA    |
|        |           | @GROUP/9 |          | @QRP     | @POTA    |
|        |           |          |          | @QRO     | @IOTA    |


#### @JS8NET and @APRSIS

Available are two "special" groups for spotting. When spotting
stations receive messages to these @JS8NET and @APRSIS groups, the
messages are posted to the JS8NET spotting server for processing. This
allows for specialized functionality to be built to handle these
messages. These groups are non-standard, so you cannot add them to
your groups list for standard group processing. However, you can send
messages to these groups directly (type it into your TX message box,
save it to your saved messages, etc).

The **@APRSIS** group is an *experimental* feature allowing APRS messages
to be spotted to the APRS-IS gateway. Two message commands are
available, GRID for spotting your callsign at a specific location and
CMD for sending a raw APRS packet.

For example, any station receiving my message:

`KN4CRD: @APRSIS GRID FN04TV53`

Will submit that spot to JS8NET and spot my callsign at that location
to the APRS network. You would then be able to query that spot in an
APRS client, like [https://aprs.fi](https://aprs.fi/)

To send a raw frame (say a direct APRS message to SMSGTE), we'd send:

`KN4CRD: @APRSIS CMD :SMSGTE :@5551212 TEST`

Everything after the CMD frame is forwarded in an APRS packet, like:

`[KN4CRD](https://aprs.fi/?c=raw&limit&call=KN4CRD)\>APZJS8,qAS,KN4CRD::SMSGTE:@5551212 TEST`

#### Directed Commands:

There are special directed messages that you can send to stations to
have them automatically reply if they have AUTO enabled. They are
comprised in the form of \[CALLSIGN\]\[COMMAND\].

- SNR? - What is my SNR?
- GRID? - What is your grid locator?
- INFO? - What is your station information?
- STATUS? - What is your station status message?
- HEARING? - What stations are you HEARING?
-  \-\--

- \>\[MESSAGE\] - Please relay this message to its destination
  - When received in its entirety, the destination station will send an
    `ACK` reply to the message
  - Optionally, this message can be relayed to its final destination through multiple relay stations by prefixing additional callsigns to the message:

    - `KN4CRD\>HELLO!` (will send the message to KN4CRD)

    - `KN4CRD\>DR4CNK\>HELLO!` (will send the message to DR4CNK through KN4CRD)

    - `KN4CRD\>DR4CNK\>J0Y\>HELLO!` (will send the message to J0Y through DR4CNK through KN4CRD)

  - Stations will respond to a subset of commands issued through forwarded messages (SNR, INFO, GRID, MSG, MSG TO:, etc) 
    and will reply using the relay path provided.

  - Prefixing a directed MSG with the redirect \> symbol when sending to a station in the call list will request the destination station to
    send an ACK without the MSG going thru the user's Inbox.

- MSG \[MESSAGE\] - Please store and display this message in your inbox
  - Your inbox messages can be accessed by right clicking on the callsign and selecting "View Message Inbox..."

- MSG TO:\[CALLSIGN\] \[MESSAGE\] - Please store this message at your station for later retrieval by \[CALLSIGN\]
  - Stores a message in persistent storage (on disk) to be retrieved later using the "QUERY MSGS" command.
  - \[CALLSIGN\] is the first word after the : and is the final recipient of the message.

- QUERY CALL \[CALLSIGN\]? - Can you communicate directly with CALLSIGN?
  - If a station can hear the callsign, they will send back "YES" and then an ACK to that callsign with an SNR report

- QUERY MSG \[ID\] - Please deliver the complete message identified by ID

- QUERY MSGS - Please deliver any messages you have stored for me
  - Each response will contain the ID of oldest message yet to be delivered.
  - To retrieve the message text, issue a QUERY MSG command with the ID

- AGN? - Have the station automatically retransmit their last message

- \-\--

- SNR - Send signal report
- INFO - Send station information
- GRID - Send a long-form grid locator (to be spotted on a map via PSKReporter & JS8NET)

 There are also a number of "short messages" that can be included in a
 directed message frame, which would be transmitted in one tx cycle
 with standard (non-compound, non-group) callsigns:

- QSL? - Did you receive my last transmission?
- QSL - I received your last transmission
- YES - I confirm your last inquiry
- NO - I negative confirm your last inquiry
- HW CPY? - How do you copy?
- RR - Roger. Received. I copy.
- FB - Fine Business
- TU - Thank You
- 73 - I send my Best Regards
- SK - End of Contact
- DIT DIT - End of Contact / Two Bits

#### Message Examples:

If we wanted to ask DR4CNK what their station information was, we'd send:

- `DR4CNK INFO?`

  - And they would respond with a directed message back to us:

  `DR4CNK: KN4CRD INFO 50W VERT IN THE SOUTH OF FRANCE`
  
  automatically if AUTO reply is enabled.

If we wanted to transmit a "relay" message to OH8STN through DR4CNK,
we could use the relay command and send:

- `DR4CNK\>OH8STN\>HELLO JULIAN!`

  - During relay, at each hop the originating sender's call is appended to the message.

  - The command above would be received by OH8STN, they would send an ACK back, then retransmit the message, like so:

    - KN4 station sends:

        `KN4CRD: DR4CNK\>OH8STN\>HELLO JULIAN!`

    - DR4 station relays:

        ` DR4CNK: OH8STN\>HELLO JULIAN! DE KN4CRD`

You can also mix and match standard and free text messages, but most of the time you won't need to.

### Inbox - Message Storage and Retrieval

Directed messaging allows three commands to be used for message storage and retrieval at intermediate stations:

- MSG TO:\[CALLSIGN\] \[MESSAGE\] - Store this MESSAGE at an intermediate station for CALLSIGN

- QUERY MSGS - Query the destination for messages stored for your station callsign

- QUERY MSG \[ID\] - Query for a specific message stored for your station callsign

TODO: We'll eventually add an example here :)

### AUTO - Automatic Replies

While AUTO is enabled, the software will automatically respond to
directed queries, like "SNR?", "INFO?", and "GRID?". When AUTO is
turned off, JS8Call will buffer responses to directed queries in the
send message textbox until you are ready to send the replies manually.

If you would like to participate in AUTO, but would not like to be
responsible for message relays, you can disable relays while AUTO is
enabled in the settings.

### LOG - Station Log

There's a log item in the main menu of the application. You can also
press F5 to start a log entry. The software will do its best effort to
pre-populate log fields. However, you'll likely have to fill out some
missing information manually since the QSO is free-text and not
automated.

The log is stored in JS8Call.log & JS8Call.adif in the log directory
(which you can find by clicking "File -\> Open log directory" in the
main menu).

Currently, the logging function in JS8Call will log each contact,
according to the ADIF spec, as MFSK mode and JS8 submode. There is
also an option in the Logging settings to log the mode as DATA instead
of MFSK & JS8.

Once logged, the selected directed callsign is automatically
deselected by default, however this option can be overridden in the
configuration.

### SPOT - Callsign Spotting

When SPOT is enabled, JS8Call will report callsigns you hear (or your
callsign if heard by other stations) to PSKReporter under the
"JS8Call" mode.

JS8Call will also spot GRID commands with 6 or more characters. Make
sure to set your grid locator to 6-12 characters for the most accurate
spot. You can drill down with this map to your location if you're
unsure of your grid:
[http://k7fry.com/grid/](http://k7fry.com/grid/). If you have a
lat/lon, you can also use the lonlat2maiden script here:
[http://www.jidanni.org/geo/maidenhead/](http://www.jidanni.org/geo/maidenhead/)

### HB - Heartbeat Transmission

There is an automated heartbeat mechanism that transmits on an
interval. You can turn on the HB button by selecting "Enable Heartbeat
Networking" from the mode menu. An HB button will then appear on the
bottom left. This automated transmission will transmit your grid to
the heartbeat network (directed to the @HB group callsign:

`KN4CRD: @HB HEARTBEAT EM73 ♢`

This interval at which the heartbeat transmits can be changed from the
control menu or by right clicking the HB button. All heartbeats are
transmitted on a random (unused) frequency offset between 500Hz-1000Hz
to help prevent QRM. There is an option in the settings to allow
heartbeating anywhere...which is especially useful on lower bands
like 160m and 630m.

When you have AUTO replies enabled and you've selected to Send
Heartbeat Acknowledgements, your station will send an ACK reply to
signal to the other operator that you can hear them. These are
essentially "lightweight heartbeats" from your station and will reset
your heartbeat timer.

The intent of heartbeat is not to report on propagation. Instead it is
to help populate your call activity (the heard list on the right) so
you know who\'s likely to be reachable to make contact. You can\'t
work them if you can\'t "hear" them (or if they cannot hear you).

Keep in mind, though, that HBs are not designed to start
conversations. When you turn HB on, you're "joining" the heartbeat
network. This network allows for planning of relays and sending
messages to be stored at those receiving stations. Think of HBs and
ACKs as a way to plot network topology and relays (\"\>\") as a way to
send messages to be read later (sort of like an SMS text message)
through that network.

While heartbeating, if a station has a message to deliver to another
station it hears heartbeating, it will announce that in a HEARTBEAT
SNR, like so:

`KN4CRD: KM4ACK HEARTBEAT SNR -12 MSG 32 ♢`

You can then retreive that message using the "QUERY MSG" directed
command:

`KM4ACK: KN4CRD QUERY MSG 32`

While in QSO (i.e., when you receive a transmission that is displayed
in your incoming messages window) the HB timer will be reset to
prevent your station from QRMing your QSO. Versions 2.4.0 and later
have "intelligent" HB ACK handling that will disable your automatic HB
ACK's if MSG'ing activity is detected in the bandpass. This prevents
automated transmissions from QRMing not only your incoming MSG's, but
also those of other operators. Both the Mode and Repeat buttons will
indicate when the "intelligent" HB ACK handling is in effect by
turning off the ACK designator on the buttons (if you have HB ACK's
enabled).

Also, keep in mind that unattended transmissions may be against the
rules of your jurisdiction. To be most safe, heartbeat should only be
automatically sent while you're at the control point of your station.
There's an idle timer that you can configure in the settings that will
disable your heartbeat once you leave your station idle (no mouse or
keyboard movement).

``NOTE: HBs are intentionally restricted to slow, normal and fast speeds
for bandwidth efficiency and enhanced compatibility in the HB network.``

### CQ - Calling CQ

The default way to call cq is with the "CQ CQ CQ" message. This is
configured by default. What's notable, though, is that you can
configure this message in the settings. These are the messages
supported to be sent in one frame transmission:

- CQ CQ CQ
- CQ CQ
- CQ
- CQ CONTEST
- CQ FIELD
- CQ FD
- CQ QRP
- CQ DX

When using one of these message formats, you can also include your 4
digit grid and it will be encoded in one transmission cycle:

- CQ CQ CQ EM73
- CQ CQ BB88
- CQ CC77
- CQ CONTEST FN04
- CQ FIELD AB01
- CQ FD CN01
- CQ QRP JO42
- CQ DX GC28

You can start your CQ message with one of these formats and it will be
sent directed, meaning your callsign will automatically be included.
You can also add to the messages without issue:

- CQ QRP 500MW CQ?

If you deviate from these formats, you will not be sending a directed
message, your grid will not be included, and you must include your
callsign in your message.

You can also send CQs on an interval by right clicking the CQ button
and selecting a repeat interval. This will cause your station to
repeat your CQ transmission until a message is received.

### REPLY - Replying to a CQ

The default way to reply to a cq is with "HW CPY?". This allows the
caller to choose who to connect with and send a signal report to. You
can customize this message with a reply, but keep in mind that most
stations will be replying with something that can be send in one
15-second transmission. Here's an example exchange:

  - **→** ``KN4CRD: CQ QRP EM73♢``

  - **←** ``DR4CNK: KN4CRD HW CPY?♢``

  - **→** ``KN4CRD: DR4CNK SNR -12 TU 4 CALL QSL?♢``

  - **←** ``DR4CNK: KN4CRD RR -22 FB INTO GO28 GUD QRP DX!♢``

## Configuration

### General (Station and Behavior)

**TODO**

### Radio (CAT and PTT control)

There is an advanced feature for rig control called PTT Command. This
allows JS8Call to execute an external script for controlling a rig's
PTT:

<img src="JS8Call_User_Guide_html_cbd95a8f.jpg" style="width:5.1866in;height:3.7374in">

What this PTT command does is allow you to execute **any** command
line script to toggle your Rig's PTT line.

In the above example, the toggle-ptt script will be called with the `-p
17 and -s parameters` on transmit. The `%1` in the above command will be
replaced with "on" or "off" depending on the state of the PTT. If you
do not add a `%1` in your command, "on" and "off" will be appended to
the end of the command for invocation.

Example:

If you define your PTT command as: ``/usr/bin/ptt %1``

When JS8Call starts transmitting, it will execute: ``/usr/bin/ptt "on"``

And when JS8Call has finished transmitting, it will execute: ``/usr/bin/ptt "off"``

This is particularly helpful for Raspberry Pi / DRAWS when the GPIO
ports are used to control your rig PTT. An example script can be found
here: [https://gist.github.com/jsherer/dd09895ab23bdf571e2117cdd814c198](https://gist.github.com/jsherer/dd09895ab23bdf571e2117cdd814c198)

### Audio (Sound Card)

When choosing your sound card, you have the option to set individual
devices for input and output. You'll need to find the device that
matches what you've integrated with your rig. You can choose Mono or
Stereo input/output, so try matching those with the capabilities of
your device.

For best decoding, when configuring your audio devices you need to
apply the right input/output levels:

1.  Make sure the sound card device you have chosen for input has no
    microphone amplification enabled Usually you set this at the
    operating system level. Set the input to 100%.

2.  Move your VFO to a quiet part of the band that has no signals present

3.  Set your rig's AF Gain to its maximum value

4.  Start adjusting your rig's RF Gain to the point where the s-meter just starts to read 0

5.  If RF Gain is not enough to bring down the rig's s-mete, apply your
    rig's attenuator. This is usual during noisy band conditions or
    RFI locally. Most attenuators apply a -10dB to -15dB signal
    attenuation, so you can usually bring RF Gain up just a touch to
    match.

6.  If those adjustments are still not enough, you're likely operating
    under an extremely noisy condition. You might have luck at this
    point to start playing with AF Gain to bring the input levels even
    further down to that sweet spot of 30-60dB as read by the meter in
    the app.

### Reporting (Spotting and API)

**TODO**

### Frequencies (Calling Frequencies and Band Hopping)

Most operators testing the application can be found +/- 4-8kHz from
the standard FT8 frequencies. It is essential to avoid the main FT8
frequencies, as that will cause confusion among WSJT-X operators. Here
are some suggested frequencies to use:

|         |           |          |          |          |         |      |
|--------:|-----------|----------|----------|----------|---------|------|
| **Band** | **Frequency** | **Hz** | | **Spacing** | **Above/below** | **Mode** |
| 160M | 1.842  | MHz | // | 2kHZ | above | FT8 |
|  80M | 3.578  | MHz | // | 5kHz | above | FT8 |
|  40M | 7.078  | MHz | // | 4kHz | above | FT8 |
|  30M | 10.130 | MHz | // | 6kHz | below | FT8 |
|  20M | 14.078 | MHz | // | 4kHz | above | FT8 |
|  17M | 18.104 | MHz | // | 4kHz | above | FT8 |
|  15M | 21.078 | MHz | // | 4kHz | above | FT8 |
|  12M | 24.922 | MHz | // | 9kHz | above | FT8 |
|  10M | 28.078 | MHz | // | 4kHz | above | FT8 |
|   6M | 50.318 | MHz | // | 5kHz | above | FT8 |
|   2M |144.178 | MHz | // | 4kHz | above | FT8 |

You might notice a few of these being close to the JT9 frequencies.
Don't grab your pitchforks! JS8Call blocks out transmitting within the
lower 500Hz of the passband. This leaves enough room for 25
simultaneous JT9 signals.

You might also notice that there are a few bands missing from this
list. JS8Call does not make a recommendation for calling frequencies
on 2200m, 630m, 60m, or higher than 2m, as many of these bands are
special cases and have unique rules in many jurisdictions. It's up to
the operator(s) to coordinate and determine the best frequency and
operating pattern on these bands.

But also, please keep in mind these are only *suggested* frequencies.
We all have VFOs, so please use them. Just remember to be good
operators and prevent from interfering with other signals on our
shared bands.

You **CAN** type in any frequency. JS8Call will not limit which
frequencies you can manually transmit on. You can use the groups.io
mailing list to schedule on other frequencies with test operators.

If you want to transmit on a non-standard frequency (recommended) you
can either modify the frequencies list in the settings, or you can
type directly into the band dropdown box in the top left of the
screen.

<center><img src="JS8Call_User_Guide_html_b85d29c1.gif" style="width:5.1866in;height:3.7374in"></center>

If you'd like to add custom frequencies for JS8Call, you can do so in
the settings:

<center><img src="JS8Call_User_Guide_html_31ca1f8d.jpg" style="width:5.1866in;height:3.7374in"></center>

If you'd like to reset to the suggested frequencies, right click the
frequencies box and click Reset.

<center><img src="JS8Call_User_Guide_html_c384a06.jpg" style="width:5.1866in;height:3.7374in"></center>

### Saved Messages (Macros)

There are a few quick saved message buttons for transmitting common
messages. You can edit these in the settings window. Just be mindful
that long messages will take a while to send.

Saved messages have macro-like functionality. These are the macros
variables (words that are surrounded by \<\> characters) that can be used 
in saved messages which will be replaced when sending the message:

```
  <MYCALL>     My Callsign
  <MYGRID4>    My 4 digit grid locator
  <MYGRID12>   My extended grid locator up to 12 digits
  <MYINFO>     My Station Information Message
  <MYCQ>       My CQ Message
  <MYHB>       My HB Message
  <MYREPLY>    My Reply Message
  <MYSTATUS>   My Station Status Message
  <MYVERSION>  My JS8Call Version
  <MYIDLE>     My Station Idle Time (no keyboard/mouse movement)
  <CALL>       Selected Callsign
  <SNR>        The SNR for the Selected Callsign
  <TDELTA>     The time delta for the Selected Callsign
```
- These macros also apply to configured messages like CQ, Reply, INFO, etc.

## Tips & Tricks

1.  - Be a good citizen...if you see a CQ you should try answering it before calling CQ yourself.
    - If you hear no CQs, call CQ!

2.  - An example QSO:

      - **→** ``KN4CRD: CQCQCQ EM73♢``

      - **←** ``DR4CNK: KN4CRD SNR +01 GOOD SIGNAL♢``

      - **→** ``KN4CRD: DR4CNK SNR -12 TU 4 CALL RIG IS KX2 5W DIPOLE♢``

      - **←** ``DR4CNK: KN4CRD RR -22 FB KX3 100W VERT♢``

      - **→** ``KN4CRD: DR4CNK RR FB REALLY ENJOYING THE CHAT MODE WITH LONG
                MESSAGES. BUT HEY LET'S TRY A RELAY ♢``

      - *... (and on, and on, if you want)*

      - **→** ``KN4CRD: DR4CNK 73♢``

      - **→** ``KN4CRD: @ALLCALL QRZ?♢``

3.  - You **do not** need to include your callsign when initiating your
      directed replies. They will be prefixed to your message
      automatically when you have a callsign selected in your heard
      list.

4.  - You do not have to reply on the same frequency offset as the
      caller. But, if you're calling another station off their
      frequency, you need to include their callsign at the beginning
      of the the message so it is directed to them and will show up 
      in their yellow directed activity window.

5.  - Directed messages pack as much data as standard FT8 frames. The
      following examples are all 1 transmit cycle long

      - Example:

        - ``KN4CRD/P: CQCQCQ EM73`` (1 transmit frame)

        - ``VE3/KN4CRD: CQ QRP EM73`` (1 transmit frame)

        - ``KN4CRD: @ALLCALL?`` (1 transmit frame)

        - ``DR4CNK: KN4CRD SNR +15`` (1 transmit frame)

        - ``DR4CNK: KN4CRD AGN?`` (1 transmit frame)

6.  - For replying to a station's CQ, double click their call in the
      call activity window, then either choose a directed command or
      type a message to them:

      - ``DR4CNK: KN4CRD HW CPY?``

      - ``DR4CNK: KN4CRD SNR +12``

      - ``DR4CNK: KN4CRD YES``

      - ``DR4CNK: KN4CRD NO``

      - ``DR4CNK: KN4CRD RR``

      - ``DR4CNK: KN4CRD 73``

      - ``DR4CNK: KN4CRD HELLO MY FRIEND GREAT TO HEAR YOU!``

7.  - You can send free-text at any time! That's what JS8Call was
      inspired by:

      - ``HI JIM TU 4 CALL UR -12 INTO ATLANTA BTU DE KN4CRD`` (4 transmit frames)

    - It might be helpful to learn some of the morse code
      prosign/abbreviations and psk31 abbreviations:

      - [*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosigns_for_Morse_code*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosigns_for_Morse_code)

      - [*http://www.hamblog.co.uk/common-psk31-abbreviations/*](http://www.hamblog.co.uk/common-psk31-abbreviations/)

      - Examples:

        - K - over

        - BTU - back to you

        - FB - fine business

        - HW? - how do you copy?

8.  - But, in general, you can just type words and sentences and let the
      code compress it efficiently.

      - Now, there *is* a word suggestion feature that marks up your
        transmission text while you are typing your message (like a
        spell check). It will mark words that do not appear in the
        code dictionary (often, weird abbreviations), because
        counterintuitively, using a lot of abbreviations will often
        result in LESS efficient transmission.

      - Example:

        - Say we transmit ``CONGRATULATIONS AND WELL WISHES FRIEND``.
          This compresses to 67 bits, for 20 words per minute and 1.76 bits per 
          character (34 characters) in one transmit cycle.

      - But, let's say you want to be clever and use some weird
          abbreviations to help it transmit faster... ``CNGRATS ES WL
          WISHS FRND`` has 10 fewer characters. but compresses to 122
          bits, for 10 words per minute and 5.08 bits per character.
          That's almost 2x the bits (and clearly IS 2x the number of
          transmit cycles)

9.  - JS8Call imposes minimal restrictions on you, the operator. It is
      up to you and you alone to abide by (or break) the rules of your
      license and jurisdiction.

## Frequently Asked Questions

  - What is considered a JS8 contact?
      - An amateur radio contact is a two-way exchange of information
        between two stations.

      - However, a contact is really what you make of it. It could be
        minimal information, it could be a 60 minute ragchew. If the
        contact is for an award or contest, then there are rules for
        what determines a valid contact.

      - Your callsign, a signal report, your name, your location, your
        rig details, what the weather is like, etc are all good things
        to communicate.

      - Keep in mind that the free-text nature of JS8 is what makes it
        valuable. You can exchange **any** information in your
        contact. If all you're exchanging is your grid and signal
        report, then FT8 is probably a better option for you.

  - What are the random three (or six) characters at the end of relay
      and acked message commands?

      - These are a checksum for the message added to ensure all of the
        message frames were delivered correctly before retransmitting
        / alerting. If received in its entirety by the receiving
        station, these checksums will not be displayed to them.

  - You said that all printable uppercase ASCII characters can be
      used. Do some take more time to send than others?

      - Yes. The characters that are sent in the messages are variable
        encoded, ranging from 3 to 19 bits in length based on their
        probability of being used in a sentence. The most common
        characters take the least amount of space, allowing us to send
        more than 13 characters per transmission cycle on average.

      - Example: `Space` and `E` are only 2.5 bits in length. You could send
        about 22 (!!) of them in a single transmission. Whereas a
        character like ``{`` is more like 14 bits in length, you could
        only send 4 of those. (But really, how frequently do you use
        that character?)

      - Here are some examples of phrases that could be sent in one 15
        second transmit cycle:

        - ``EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE`` (22 characters)

        - ``I HAVE EATEN A SHOE`` (20 words per minute)

        - ``WHICH WAY TO OHIO`` (16 words per minute)

        - ``NEVER HAVE I EVER`` (16 words per minute)

        - ``TU UR 599 4A GA`` (20 words per minute)

        - Etc

  - How fast does JS8Call transmit?

      - JS8Call normal mode uses the same 15-second transmission cycle
        as FT8. What is different is that due to the variable encoding
        of the characters, JS8Call can transmit up to 22 characters
        per transmission frame. For average sentences, JS8Call can
        pack words very tightly, at around 15 WPM.

      - Example:

        - ``WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT THAT ALL MEN ARE
          CREATED EQUAL THAT THEY ARE ENDOWED BY THEIR CREATOR WITH
          CERTAIN UNALIENABLE RIGHTS THAT AMONG THESE ARE LIFE LIBERTY
          AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS``

          - This phrase is 35 words. It would take 10 transmission
            cycles to send (2 minutes 30 seconds). That is about 14
            WPM.

        - ``A SUCCESSFUL MAN IS ONE WHO CAN LAY A FIRM FOUNDATION WITH
            THE BRICKS OTHERS HAVE THROWN AT HIM``

          - This phrase is 19 words. It would take 5 transmission cycles
            to send (1 minute 15 seconds). That is just over 15 WPM.

        - ``THIS IS A TEST OF JS8``

          - This phrase is 6 words and takes 1 transmission cycle to
            send (15 seconds). That is 24 WPM.

      - Morse code has a neat way of calculating WPM, timing how long it
        takes to transmit the word PARIS. In JS8Call, PARIS is encoded
        into 17 bits (3.4 bits/character). Each transmission cycle can
        pack up to 69 character bits. That equates to about 16 WPM.
        (69/17=4.05 words / (15 seconds \* 4))

      - The app shows this in the status bar:

<center><img src="JS8Call_User_Guide_html_265eb9ef.jpg" style="width:5.1866in;height:3.7374in"></center>

  - Isn't 10-20 WPM too slow to have a conversation?

      - If propagation is good enough for a faster mode, you should be
        using it instead! But, with poor conditions like we have
        experienced at solar minimum, JS8Call might just be the best
        balance.

      - It may seem really slow (and it is, relatively speaking).
        However, FT8 modulation is able to decode (theoretically) down
        to -24dB below the 2500 Hz noise floor. Not many modes can say
        this, especially those which transmit at faster speeds. What
        does this mean? JS8Call may work when other modes cannot.

      - **We believe that communicating slowly is better than not
        communicating at all.**

  - What is the JS8Call Relay Challenge?

      - This is a friendly competition to maximize the number of
        continents one can pass a message back and forth to using the
        relay command.

      - We'll be giving away an award (and prize) to the first team of
        operators to successfully relay a message from one continent
        across three other continents (NA, SA, EU, AF, AS, OC, AN) and
        relay an ACK back to the original station using JS8Call. All
        you need to do is submit your logs from each station and
        optionally photographic/video documentation of your effort.

      - For example, this is what the outgoing and incoming messages
        could be:

        - ``KN4CRD\>LB9YH\>VK1MIC QSL?``

        - ``VK1MIC\>LB9YH\>KN4CRD QSL``

    - Does Heartbeat (HB) mode violate FCC 97.221 Automatically
      Controlled Digital Station rules in the United States?

      - For operators in the United States, here's a reference to the
        rules:
        [http://www.arrl.org/part-97-text](http://www.arrl.org/part-97-text)

      - With this, keep in mind:

        - The control operator is responsible for the station
          operation. The software makes a best effort to require a
          human to be present during operation (HB off by default, a
          watchdog timer feature built-in, etc). It is up to the
          operator to make sure they are in compliance with the rules
          of their jurisdiction.

        - Responses to directed queries by non-automatic stations
          fall under §97.221.C.1 exemption.

      - It is recommended that operators to turn off HB repetition when
        not at the station control point, but, they should feel
        comfortable leaving AUTO on while they are away since their
        station would only be responding to queries initiated by a
        non-automatic station.

  - Do message relays (\>) violate FCC 97.113.d rules in the United
      States?

      - For operators in the United States, here's a reference to the
        rules:
        [http://www.arrl.org/part-97-text](http://www.arrl.org/part-97-text)

      - Some background:

        - Repeater stations (definition 40) are stations which
          re-transmit radio signals simultaneously on a different
          frequency.

        - Message forwarding systems (definition 32) are explicitly
          allowed in FCC 97.219.

      - JS8 message relays **do not** automatically retransmit
        radio signals on the same or a different frequency. Doing so
        would make the function a repeater. Instead, the JS8Call
        software cooperates in a message forwarding system, creating a
        new message to be forwarded via *new* radio signals. These new
        signals include the original message, a checksum of the
        message, and the relay path back to the originating station.

  - Why isn't my station responding to @ALLCALL?

      - Previous versions of JS8Call (FT8Call) had a directed message of
        `@ALLCALL?` that had stations return SNR reports
        automatically. This has been replaced, starting in version 0.7
        of JS8Call, with HB and ACKs. Stations will no longer respond
        to the "@ALLCALL?" query.

      - A similar query can be had by issuing: ``@ALLCALL QUERY CALL
        [callsign]?``

  - Why isn't my station acknowledging (ACK) other heartbeats (HB)?

      - You have to turn on HB Acknowledgements and have AUTO enabled to
        ACK other stations. This means, the order of operations are:

        - Turn on AUTO

        - Right click HB, select "Send Heartbeat Acknowledgements"

        - Your station will now ACK other heartbeats.

  - Can I run multiple copies of JS8Call side-by-side?

      - Yes! There is a -r/\--rig-name flag you can pass on the command
        line to give each instance a unique name. This creates a
        separate directory for your configuration and log files, so
        you can run multiple rigs at the same time.

        - You can do this by running js8call from the command line with
          this parameter, like:

          - js8call \--rig-name FT817

        - Or, if you are on Windows, create a shortcut for each unique
          name/config:

          - Create a shortcut to JS8Call on your desktop.

          - Right click and select properties.

          - Under the \"General\" tab edit the name of the shortcut with
            a unique name, like \"JS8Call FT817\".

          - Under the \"Shortcut\" tab add this to the target line.

          - Leave a space after .exe then \--rig-name=FT817 (replace
            FT817 with anything that uniquely identifies your rig)

          - Something like: ``C:\Program Files (x86)\js8call\bin\js8call.exe --rig-name=FT817``

  - Can I use group callsigns to run a net?

      - Yes! You would do so by announcing which group callsign your net
        will be using. If you do not want to use a custom group, @NET
        is sufficient.

      - All stations who will participate in the net will need to add
        the group callsign to their station configuration.

      - To facilitate fast check-ins, you can issue an SNR? command to
        the group and log the replying stations as checked-in.

  - What does the decoder sensitivity actually do?

      - Great question. Decoder sensitivity setting determines how much
        time will be spent on decoding during a decoding cycle. Each
        sensitivity level changes the behavior of the decoder
        somewhat:

      - - (1x) One Decode Pass - The decoder will do one pass using
          belief propagation and try to decode any signals it detects.

        - (2x) Two Decode Passes - The decoder will subtract any signals
          that were decoded in the first pass and try again.

        - (3x) Three Decode Passes - The decoder will perform three
          subtraction passes using belief propagation with ordered
          statistics

        - (4x) Four Decode Passes - The decoder will perform four
          subtraction passes using belief propagation with ordered
          statistics.

      - **NOTE**: You may have to run with a lower sensitivity if you
          have a low power machine or if your CPU cannot keep up with
          the decoder.

      - **NOTE**: Higher sensitivity levels that use ordered statistics
          have a higher chance of producing a "false decode" (i.e.,
          noise that matches the sync pattern and passes the checksum
          process). This tradeoff is intentional. If you would like to
          avoid false decodes, you can decrease your sensitivity to 1x
          or 2x.

  - I love what you're doing. Do you have a PayPal or Patreon where I
      can send you a donation as a "Thank you?"

      - I appreciate the gesture! I continue to work on this project as
        a donation of my time to the Amateur Radio ecosystem. I'm not
        looking for payment of any kind. If you feel so obliged,
        however, I'd appreciate it if you instead sent along any
        donation you'd like to make to a local charity of your
        choosing. Something like the American Red Cross, Salvation
        Army, or even a local Amateur Radio club. They'd put that
        money to far better use!

  - What does Joe Taylor, K1JT (or the WSJT-X development team) think
      of JS8Call?

      - We have not heard anything from him/them, so you'll have to
        reach out and ask!

      - However, as you can see in the History section at the start of
        the document, I did receive acknowledgement from Joe before
        pursuing the JS8Call project back in February 2018:

## Troubleshooting

If you're having trouble, head over to the troubleshooting chatroom
for help:
[https://groups.io/g/JS8Call/chat/1423](https://groups.io/g/ft8call/chat/1423)
or email Jordan directly:

### Common Problems & Solutions

#### JS8Call will not run on my system

Make sure you are running a supported operating system, that you have
disabled any programs that may be using your audio device, or
preventing JS8Call from using the audio device...like an aggressive
antivirus. If you're running Windows, and have a Windows Defender
running, you'll need to either whitelist JS8Call or turn off the
defender.

#### I see signals on the waterfall but I cannot decode them

Make sure the signals you are seeing are actually JS8Call signals and
not FT8 signals (they are incompatible) by ensuring you're on one of
the JS8Call frequencies. Make sure you are in Upper Sideband (USB)
mode.

Make sure you have synchronized your clock to within 2 seconds of UTC.
Make sure you're not running WSJT-X at the same time.

#### I do not see any signals on the waterfall

Check your incoming audio from your rig. Make sure JS8Call audio is
configured correctly. That means allowing JS8Call to access the
"microphone" in the system privacy settings and making sure the levels
are set correctly.

Check to make sure you're on one of the JS8Call frequencies. Keep in
mind that JS8Call is still in development and has more than *an order
of magnitude fewer operators* on the air. There may actually be nobody
on within your reception range. Check PSKReporter to see if there are
others on the band. If you still cannot see any signals, either:

1)  You have an RX problem with your station
2)  None of the operators are operating on the band you are on
3)  Or propagation isn't being friendly to you

NOTE: Keep in mind that JS8Call isn't magic...we're still at the
mercy of the ionosphere.

#### My rig won't transmit

Check your outgoing audio to your rig. Make sure JS8Call audio is
configured correctly. Unplug the rig from the computer and hook up the
output to a set of headphones or speakers. Try to transmit, maybe with
the TUNE button in the app. Can you hear the tones? If not, then you
have an audio problem, if so then you have a transceiver problem. Make
sure your PTT is configured correctly for your rig or use VOX. You can
test this in the settings. The PTT button will turn green if it can
key your transmitter. If you have audio into the rig, but still have
no RF out, make sure your rig is configured correctly by checking your
digital gain / tx gain / mic levels.

After that, make sure your rig works...switch over to FM or CW and
send a carrier to make sure the rig can actually transmit at all.

#### Bug Reports

You can send bug reports to Jordan Sherer (KN4CRD) at
[kn4crd@gmail.com](mailto:kn4crd@gmail.com) or submit them to the
issue tracker here:

## API Definition

JS8Call uses a JSON API offered over UDP and TCP. More detailed
documentation will be available in the future.

## Technical Implementation

JS8Call is under active development and details about the technical
implementation are subject to change. Detail will be added here as the
implementation stabilizes. Until then, the code is the source of truth
for the implementation.

### Modulation

JS8Call uses JS8 modulation as the base transport for data. Being a
derivative of WSJT-X, JS8Call heavily leverages the work by the WSJT-X
Development Group on the FT8 mode.

|           |                 |                     |               |                              |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------------|---------------|------------------------------|
| **Speed** | **TX Duration** | **Tones / Symbols** | **Baud Rate** | **Tone Spacing / Bandwidth** |
| SLOW      | 25.28 seconds   | 8 / 79              | 3.125 baud    | 3.125Hz / 25Hz               |
| NORMAL    | 12.64 seconds   | 8 / 79              | 6.25 baud     | 6.25Hz / 50Hz                |
| FAST      | 7.9 seconds     | 8 / 79              | 10 baud       | 10Hz / 80Hz                  |
| TURBO     | 3.95 seconds    | 8 / 79              | 20 baud       | 20Hz / 160Hz                 |

Normal speed is the closest relative to FT8. It uses 3 blocks of 7
tones 7x7 Costas array for synchronization for backwards
compatibility.

Fast, Turbo, and Slow speeds use 3 blocks of 7 tones with each block
transmitting a unique 7x7 Costas array. This allows for more accurate
synchronization.

Based on the modulation bandwidth and error correction, under AWGN
with all else being equal:

  - Slow is 3dB more sensitive than Normal (+3dB)

  - Fast is 2dB less sensitive than Normal (-2dB)

  - Turbo is 3dB less sensitive than Fast and 6dB less sensitive than
      Normal (-6dB)

### Protocol

The JS8Call protocol sits at a layer above the base transport. Much of
the implementation is inspired by the design document:
[https://github.com/jsherer/ft8call](https://github.com/jsherer/ft8call)
with a few deviations from the original proposal.

Messages in JS8Call are transmitted in intervals (frames), with each
frame being classified as one of 6 frame types:

1.  Heartbeat

2.  Compound Callsign Partial

3.  Compound Callsign Directed Command

4.  Directed Command

5.  Data Huffman

6.  Data Dictionary

Further, each frame includes a transmission flag identifying it as:

1.  Default Frame (any frame)

2.  First Frame (first frame of the transmission)

3.  Last Frame (last frame of the transmission)

4.  Flag - Reserved (for future use) And finally, there are special
    encodings for:

    1.  Callsigns

    2.  Callsign Prefix/Suffixes

    3.  Signal Reports

    4.  Grids

#### Heartbeat

Heartbeat frames are comprised of:

  - Heartbeat Type (Heartbeat or CQ)

      - Compound Callsign

      - Grid

#### Compound Callsign Partial

Compound callsign partials are used as one-half of a 2-frame compound
transmission when one of the stations includes a compound callsign.
Compound callsign partials are always the 1st frame in a 2-frame
compound transmission, encoding the "from" portion of a directed
command with compound callsigns.

The frame includes:

  - Callsign

    - 4 character alphanumeric prefix or suffix (A-Z 0-9)

    - Grid or Numeric Value (SNR or PWR)

#### Compound Callsign Directed Command

Compound callsign directed commands are a special case for compound
callsign partials where the numeric value encodes a directed command
to be used with a compound directed message. It is one-half of a
2-frame compound transmission. Compound callsign directed commands are
always the 2nd frame in a 2-frame compound transmission, encoding the
"to" portion of a directed command with compound callsigns.

The frame includes:

  - Callsign

    - 4 character alphanumeric prefix or suffix (A-Z 0-9)

    - Directed Command

#### Directed Command

Standard callsigns can send a directed command in one frame.

The frame includes:

  - From Callsign

  - To Callsign

    - Directed Command

    - Numeric Value

#### Data

Data frames are the backbone for long-form messages in JS8Call. They
are 75-bit frames that use a variable encoding to pack character data
into the smallest transmission possible.

Data frames come in two flavors:

  - Uncompressed: All bits are used for character data using a huffman code

  - Compressed: The character data is compressed at the word level using an (s,c)-Dense Code

Data frames may need to include pad bits because of the variable
encoding that character data uses for packing. The variable encoding
used is a modified Huffman code that represents the most common
characters (based on their frequency of observation in most texts) in
fewer bits than less common characters, with the option to shift in
alternate alphabets.

The complete modified Huffman code is located in Appendix A. The
(s,c)-Dense Code tables include 260K compressible entities.

#### Callsigns

Callsigns are encoded in 28-bits as described in: EME 2000 -
[http://www.ka9q.net/papers/eme-2000.ps.gz](http://www.ka9q.net/papers/eme-2000.ps.gz)

Compound callsigns are a 50-bit encoding of 11 characters following
the format:

``\[@A-Z0-9/\]\[A-Z0-9/\]\[A-Z0-9/\]\[/\]\[A-Z0-9/\]\[A-Z0-9/\]\[A-Z0-9/\]\[/\]\[A-Z0-9/\]\[A-Z0-9/\]\[A-Z0-9/\]``

Since normal callsigns are 28-bits in length, and compound callsigns
are 50-bits in length, and the payload size is only 75 bits, there\'s
no way to transmit both in a single frame. So, when addressing a
station with a compound call, the transmission is split into two
frames, with any directed command included in the extra space of the
second frame.

#### Callsign Prefix / Suffix

Prefixes and suffixes are 4 character alphanumeric encoded in 21-bits
with a 1-bit flag to indicate whether or not it is a prefix or suffix.
Alphanumeric digits can each be encoded in 5.25 bits (there are only
1,874,161 combinations of 4 character alphanumeric prefix/suffix,
which is less than can be represented in a 21-bit number 2^21^ =
2,097,152)

#### Grids

Grids are encoded in 15-bits as described in:

[http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/k1jt/wsjtx-doc/wsjtx-main-1.7.0.html#PROTOCOL_OVERVIEW](http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/k1jt/wsjtx-doc/wsjtx-main-1.7.0.html#PROTOCOL_OVERVIEW)

## Future Work

JS8Call is an **experiment** in combining the robustness
of FT8 with a messaging and network protocol layer for weak signal
*communication*. The open source software is designed for connecting
amateur radio operators who are operating under weak signal conditions
and offers both real-time messaging, stored (inbox) messaging, message
relay, and automatic station announcements.

There are many opportunities to explore reliable messaging in the
future with the foundation laid, including:

  - [*SRARQ*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_Repeat_ARQ) 
          Selective Repeat Automatic Repeat Requests

      - Leveraging automatic frame repeats when lost during transmission

      - Selective repeats would allow for fewer transmissions than
        the current manual "AGN?" command.

  - [Store-and-forward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Store_and_forward)
           Routing

      - Automatic forwarding of stored messages to get the message
            "closer" to the destination

  - [Disruption-tolerant / Delay-tolerant Networking](https://www.nasa.gov/content/dtn)

      - Using epidemic replication to converge a message to its
            destination automatically through extremely delayed and
            disconnected routes

  - Automatic Relay Routing

      - Using the network graph to be utilized for smart real-time
            routing to an intended destination

  - Callsign verification

      - Use public key checksumming for verifying the authenticity
            of the messages passed

  - Synchronization without an accurate timing requirement

      - This would also remove the need for frames to have a pause
            between them.

  - And more!
