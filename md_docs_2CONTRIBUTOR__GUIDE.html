<li><p class="startli"><b>Basic Overview of Project Structure</b>\ The JS8Call project's main branch (sometimes called "master") is the branch to which PR's for all new features and enhancements should be submitted. It should be considered an unstable development branch, not suitable to build and run except for development purposes. It will likely be in a constant state of flux as new PR's are merged and tested.</p>
<p class="startli">Stable release branches are prefixed with <code>release/</code> followed by the release version number, and these may also include release candidate versions of a pending stable production release</p>
<p class="startli">The project maintainer core team is responsible for reviewing and merging PR's into the project. There is no set schedule for major or minor point releases. It is up to the project maintainer(s) to decide when and if main is worthy of a new release. However, the lifespan of a -rc (release candidate) should be generally considered to be no more than 30 days from the release of -rc1 for final debugging and testing before it goes to a stable production release.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md30"></a>
How to submit a PR</h1>
<ul>
<li><p class="startli">Before starting work on the code make sure you checkout main on your local repo and git pull any changes that may have been merged since the last time you updated it. It is recommended to create a development branch from main with git checkout -b 'new_branch'. You can call it anything you wish, but the idea is always to keep your local main branch in sync with upstream and only make changes to your development branches. There may be other developers making changes to the code in the same files you are working on. Keeping your local main branch up-to-date with upstream will make it much easier to rebase your development branch on main before submitting a PR.</p>
<p class="startli">Remember - it is the developer's responsibility to make sure your changes to the code build and run, and that all conflicts are resolved before submitting a PR.</p>
<p class="startli">If your PR is a work-in-process where you may want peer code review or submissions from other contributors, label the PR with &lsquo;WIP - 'TITLE OF PR&rsquo;<code>so project maintainers can skip over it when merging other PR's without wasting time to determine if it is suitable for merge into the project. In addition it is recommended to label your PR with</code>Feature<code>if you are adding a new feature.</code>Bug Fix<code>if your PR is related to such.</code>Doc<code>if you are submitting documentation.</code>Enhancement` if you are submitting an improvement that is none of the above. If applicable, if there is an issue in the issue list related to your PR you should reference the issue number.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md31"></a>
Creating a clean commit history</h1>
<ul>
<li><p class="startli">If your PR contains a number of commits it is recommended to use interactive rebasing on your local branch prior to submitting a PR and pushing it to your github repo from which the PR will be created. For instance you may have a half dozen or more commits all related to the same changes to the code. Those commits should be squashed into one. Say there is six commits related to a bug fix or feature, you can combine them into one commit with: <code>git rebase -i HEAD~6</code> and change the pick column accordingly to squash them and combine the commit comments.</p>
<p class="startli">The final step before creating a PR is to rebase your development branch on master, resolve any conflicts, build it and make sure it runs.</p>
<p class="startli">If you are not familiar with rebasing, refer to the git documentation at <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase">https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase</a></p>
<p class="startli">Remember - it is not the project maintainer(s) responsibility to build and test your PR. They expect you to submit good code that builds and runs. There may be bugs found in it later that need to be patched but the maintainer(s) do not have time to track down bad code that breaks main, or won't build and run.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md32"></a>
Bug fixes</h1>
<ul>
<li><p class="startli">The whole purpose of a release candidate is final debugging by both end users and developers before it goes to a stable production release. If you submit a bug fix PR to a release candidate branch it is likely the same bug exists in main and a PR should be submitted to main as well. The same applies the other way around - if you are working on main and squash a bug, and the same code exists in a release candidate branch, a PR for the bug fix should be submitted to both branches.</p>
<p class="startli">Under no circumstances submit PR's to a release candidate branch to get your latest and greatest feature into it, change libraries, etc.. New features go to main, only bug fixes are submitted to a release candidate. </p>
</li>
